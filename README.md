A discord that gets free games from the Epic Games Store and posts them to a channel.

Commentary:\
I had this idea about 2 years ago, but I had no idea what I was doing back then(Python + Replit on the web!?!?). I half made this in a weekend to curb my regrets with my current knowledge and due to feeling inconvenienced by the other Epic Free Games bot coaxing me to vote to set notifications.

## Features:

- Get free games this week -> /free
- Set channel to post games every release -> /setnotification

Lots of things missing such as role pinging, but this would likely need a more persistent solution by reading an SQL database. /setnotification also only works assuming there is a host 24/7 with no downtime, which is unrealistic. Making this into an actual application is unlikely, unless the existing EpicFreeGames bot decides to implode.
